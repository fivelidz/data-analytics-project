```
/personal
├── alexei/
├── laura/
├── anisha/
└── sreelakshmi/
```

To create your folder:
1. In your local terminal (VS Code), navigate to the project folder.
2. Run (replace `yourname` with your name):

   ```
   mkdir personal/yourname
   ```

3. Add a `README.md` file inside your folder to explain its purpose:

   ```
   echo "# Personal folder for Your Name" > personal/yourname/README.md
   ```

4. Stage, commit, and push your changes:

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added personal folder for Your Name"
   git push
   ```
