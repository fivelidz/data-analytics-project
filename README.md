# StreamFlix Global Viewer Insights and Conversion Dashboard

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the **StreamFlix Global Viewer Insights and Conversion Dashboard** project. The goal is to provide actionable insights into viewer preferences and behaviours for StreamFlix’s global audience.
