2 Data / modelling issues you’ll want to fix first

Row “ish India 61364” at bottom of Movie sample	Looks like a mis-aligned record (MovieID missing, fields shifted)	Delete or repair before loading

Year is float; “non_def” placeholder	DAX time functions fail	Convert to whole number, set non_def → 1995
